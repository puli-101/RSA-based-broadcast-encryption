# 2IN013_RSA-based-broadcast-encryption
Implementation and analysis of collusion-resistant broadcast encryption based on hidden RSA subgroups. Original paper published by Sigurd Eskeland.

To run certain programs it is required to install 
    pip3 install rsa
    pip3 install pycryptodome
    pip3 install sympy
    sudo apt install sagemath
    pip3 install sage

Execution
    Additionnally it is best to run the main program main.py from the "scr/" folder
    After generating multiple setup configurations, to test the continued fractions attack one needs to execute the "test_continue_fractions.py" file from the "src/" folder
